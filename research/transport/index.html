                        <p>Online tracking is a crucial component to offer an efficient public transportation system. Unfortunately, there are economic issues which makes it difficult to deploy and stimulate its wide adoption. Besides, technical issues on the GPS and mobile data communication reduces the accuracy and the overall quality in such systems. </p>

                        <p>In this research we investigate the use of low-cost hardware along with mobile apps to deal with the economic issue and a mobile crowd-sensing strategy to address the technical issues of GPS and mobile data communication, thereby improving the tracking quality. Our proposal also addresses communication security issues in crowd-sensing strategies by identifying malicious attackers.</p>
