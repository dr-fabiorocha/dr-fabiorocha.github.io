                        <p>Public street lighting management is a well known problem which can be revisited from the perspective of Smart Cities. In Smart Cities there is an interconnection of services and infrastructure to provide sustainable growth and improvements in citizens’ quality of life. In this research work, we explore new low cost technologies to create a smart street light system capable of monitoring and controlling the lamps, thus reducing the costs with maintenance and allowing a more rational use of electricity.</p>
