                <p class="font-weight-bolder text-justify">Parents are always concerned by children’s health, mainly when a child is sick. It is a common sense to check its well-being by periodically measuring its temperature, heart beat and respiratory movements. Unfortunately, in the measuring process we could disturb and wake the child and also jeopardize the measures. In the project eNurse I intend to create an embedded device to be used by small children in a non-invasive way.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">This device will be able to measure and send the some health signals such as temperature, hearth beat and respiratory movements to a mobile application. At the mobile app, the signals are shown graphically. Every time a particular signal violates the normal range, (e.g: meaning fever or hypothermia for temperature), an alarm will sound. The idea for eNurse came to me as a personal life experience. As a father of a baby girl I had to face the problem of taking care of a sick child at night which should be constantly watched for fever. My nights were not easy as I ended up waking my daughter when trying to measure her temperature. I have to say that once in a while I was so tired by lack of sleep that I was not sure about her meds nor their periodicity. I decided to do something about it to help me and help other families too. As a result the eNurse project was born.

                The device is still a prototype, as it is big, and a kind of ugly. Also, it only measures the temperature. However, after performing experiments with other sensors I am positive I can design and build an extended version. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Working with embedded systems applied to such compelling subject is both addictive and also a personal satisfaction. In my quest to create this project I had a opportunity to learn a lot about microcontrollers, mobile app development and also electronic sensors applied to human body.</p>

                      <p class="text-justify">In 2018, I had a chance to participate with eNurse in an embedded system contest #MakewithMaxim sponsored by Maxim Integrated & Mouser Electronics. The contest had two phases. In Phase, I the competitors had to submit an idea for a project using one of the three available electronic devices provided. The best ideas would receive the electronic device, so the project could be implemented. The second phase the competitors had to present the prototype. The best three projects received prizes. I am proud to be the first prize winner in the contest. Thank you so much! This recognition will keep me working in this subject with passion.</p>
